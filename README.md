This repository holds my completed Assignments for the Computer Graphics Class taken at UCLA

## Description of Course:
This course introduces the fundamental principles of Computer Graphics (CG). The lectures will divide
their focus between the mathematical foundations of computer graphics, and hands-on programming. The
same goes for Friday TA discussions, which will additionally involve Q&A, exam samples, and code
samples. A major goal of the course is to acquire better programming skills and tooling, so prepare to do
heavy programming. We will explore web browsersâ€™ developer tools, fault diagnosis, etc.
